# PhaserLearning
My first steps using the 2D game framework [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser).

The goal here is to learn how to use Phaser by first following their [getting started](http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started) and then [Making your first Phaser game](http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game)

The layout of the repository will be very simple, for now just a [nodejs](https://github.com/nodejs/node) http server (using [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)) and an index.html file that will link to html pages containing our first Phaser code.

## Test online : 

1. First Phaser game, don't get eaten [there](https://AdrienJarretier.github.io/phaser_tutorial_02)
2. [Ride the platforms and get to the top](http://adrienjarretier.github.io/Ride-on_Platforms/)
