# PhaserLearning
My first steps using the 2D game framework [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser).

The goal here is to learn how to use Phaser by first following their [getting started](http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started).

The layout of the repository will be very simple, for now just a [nodejs](https://github.com/nodejs/node) http server (using [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)) and an index.html file that will contain our first Phaser code.
